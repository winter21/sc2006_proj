# Brief introduction

**Description** : The aim of this project is to revolutionise fitness networking and accessibility in Singapore. In recent years, Singapore has witnessed an increased awareness of the importance of mental well-being, alongside physical health. The stress of work-life balance, urban living, and the pursuit of personal and professional goals have led many to seek outlets that promote both physical and mental relaxation and resilience. However, maintaining a healthy lifestyle and finding the ideal fitness community can be a challenge for both locals and expatriates. Hence, weâ€™ve created SwoleMates, a pioneering website application designed to bridge this gap by leveraging the power of APIs to enhance the gym-going experience. This innovative app not only facilitates the discovery of nearby gyms through detailed descriptions and authentic feedback from Google Reviews but also fosters a sense of community by enabling users to host and join workout sessions.
